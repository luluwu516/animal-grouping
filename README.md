# Animal grouping generator

The program is for experimental animal grouping.

I had a project about supplement feeding for swine, and before the experiment, I had to group the piglets. I randomly grouped them first, 
but the deviation of the piglets' weight was too large. It could be a better design that one of the groups had the strongest or weakest piglets, 
so I spent more than 1 hour arranging the groups. I did the same thing twice for my project, which was really a waste of time.

I decided to write a program for it then, and I did. I hope it is helpful.
